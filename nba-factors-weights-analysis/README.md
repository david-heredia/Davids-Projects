# NBA Four Factors of Success
## How Important Are They

### Motivation
Following a [visualization project](https://github.com/david-heredia/portfolio-projects/tree/main/nba-four-factors) of NBA four factors I was curious to see how important each factor was to a team's success. Specifically, I wanted to see if I could replicate NBA analytics pioneer, Dean Oliver's results of shooting (40%) being the most important, followed by turnovers (25%), rebounding (20%), and free throws (15%).

### Four Factors Background
The ["four factors"](https://www.nba.com/stats/help/faq/#!#fourfactors) of the NBA are advanced metrics on four aspects of a team's performance, namely:
   * Shooting (40%)
   * Turnovers (25%)
   * Rebounding (20%)
   * Free throws (15%)

Statistician and NBA advanced analytics pioneer Dean Oliver [estimated weights](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/factors.html), shown above in parentheses, for how important each factor is to a team's success. Each aspect is tracked using the metrics below, respectively.

* [eFG%](https://www.nba.com/stats/help/glossary/#efgpct) - Effective field goal percentage
* [TOV%](https://www.nba.com/stats/help/glossary/#tovpct) - Turnover percentage
* [OREB%](https://www.nba.com/stats/help/glossary/#opp_orebpct_) - Offensive rebounding percentage
* [FTA Rate](https://www.nba.com/stats/help/glossary/#fta_rate) - Free throw attempt rate
